# Yippee-Ki-Yay-MFA-er

Proof of concept to demonstrate how Multi-Factor Authentication can be bypassed using real-time replay attacks.  All attack POCs target the example Flask 2FA login page provided by Miguel Grinberg at https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/two-factor-auth-flask. 

#### Disclaimer

To be clear, this is not an exploit of a vulnerability in Miguel's proof-of-concept, but rather an underlying risk inherent to all OTP-based Multi-Factor Authentication. Miguel's code just happens to make a very convenient test environment for demonstrating MFA exploits.
